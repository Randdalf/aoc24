# Advent of Code 2024
This year, I'm doing Advent of Code in my very own scripting language, *gum*. It's not designed to be a general purpose language, but exercising it with Advent of Code will help to identify areas of deficiency and missing features. For example, as of the time of writing, *gum* does not support command line arguments, sets or bitwise operations.

Generate files for current day using `python new_day.py`.
